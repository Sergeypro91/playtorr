# GIT

The repository is configured with auto linting and type-checking for git pre-commit hook,
as well as rules for commit in commitlint.config based on @commitlint/config-conventional
(for a better understanding of the process, it is recommended to read the <a href="https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional">documentation</a>).
